            <h2>Thsis Statement</h2>
            In the opening paragraph <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, the sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement. It is possible that there are pathogens on the Mars. Though the likelihood is very small, we still need to prepare for the worst for it.

            <p class="quote"><q>When Carl Sagan imagined sending humans to Mars in his book "The Cosmic Connec tion," published in 1973, he posed a problem beyond such a mission's cost and complexity: the possibility that life already existed on the red planet and that it might not play nice. "It is possible that on Mars there are pathogens," he wrote, "organisms which, if transported to the terrestrial environment, might do enormous biological damage - a Martian plague." Michael Crichton imagined a related scenario in his novel "The Andromeda Strain." Such situations, in which extraterrestrial samples contain dangerous tagalong organisms, are examples of backward contamination, or the risk of material from other worlds harming Earth's biosphere. <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">"The likelihood that such pathogens exist is probably small," Sagan wrote, "but we cannot take even a small risk with a billion lives."</span></q></p>

            <ul> <!--unorder list-->
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a> - The Mars samples should be handle carefully and pristine.</b>
                    <p><q>No one can yet say for sure they are not harmful to Earthlings.</q> The Mars samples should be held in the special sample receiving facility which is capable of safely containing the most dangerous pathohens. It is also called the standard of <q>Biosafety Level 4, or BSL-4</q>. </p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a> - Regular lab is not capable for Mars samples.</b>
                    <p>The statement <q>no existing lab was both contained and clean enough for NASA</q> indicates that normal labs is not safe enough for the returned samples. The NASA scientists think that <q>facilities that handled biological horrors, maintain ultra-cleanrooms or manufacture innovative equipment for either purpose</q> might be a better place to keep the samples.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec4">[Sec. #4]</a> - Materials from Mars is different than before.</b>
                    <p>From <q>NASA deems "significant" backward contamination risk</q> we can see that these samples is different from moon rocks and dust, samples from asteroids and particles from solar wind and a comet. <q>We have to treat those samples as if they contain hazardous biological materials.</q> It is reasonable to takes the risks seriously, because we don't know how a planet works.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec5">[Sec. #5]</a> - How the Mars Sample Return mission begun.</b>
                    <p>The mission try to figure out how the planet works, which <q>cannot be done on site because scientists and their myriad instruments cannot travel there yet.</q> The author explain the process of mission in the first paragraph and indicates that it will end optimistically in 2033.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec6">[Sec. #6]</a> - The technological challenges of the Sample Receiving Facility.</b>
                    <p>The Sample Receiving Facility need to satisfied two requirements, <q>Earth doesn't touch the samples and the samples don't touch Earth.</q> , the goal of pristime and the preventtion of backward contamination. Regularly, the cleanrooms require positive air pressure while the high-containment labs need negative air pressure. It is hard to integrate two conditions in the same space. The NASA scientists need to <q>see how clean and contained facilities had kept themselves that way and to hope to determine how to best combine them.</q></p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec7">[Sec. #7]</a> - The final decision should be made soon.</b>
                    <p><q>The agency could alter an existing BSL-4 lab to be more pristine</q> or <q>build a new brick-and-mortar facility from the Earth-ground up, uniquely designed for its purposes.</q> No matter which plans NASA choose, they need to decide now. The <q>bureaucratic hangups</q> will cause the delay and present <q>significant programmatic risk</q> to the Mars Sample Return.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec8">[Sec. #8]</a> - Regulations and the public might also affect the project.</b>
                    <p>The project, Sample Receiving Facility and the space craft and its at-home facility should follows diffenrent regulations from government agencies. Also, the public is important too. <q>Being transparent with the public, Dr. Rummel said, is key not just to gaining public support but to keeping the effort accountable and safe.</q> By the <q>public interest</q>, second paragraph talk about how to prove the feasibility about the project to the public.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec9">[Sec. #9]</a> - How the Mars Sample Return mission begun.</b>

            <h2>Coherence & Cohesion</h2>
            <h3><a href="example.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a></h3>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - Section #2 is the first paragraph that follows the opening paragraph, so its first paragraph naturally carries on to elaborate on the main topic. In the first sentence <q>Early detection is key for intervention...</q>, the key phrase <q>Early detection</q> of dementia is linked back to the main topic of the essay, which creates a natural transition into the subtopic.</li>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - In the next paragraph of the same section, the first statement <q>In recent years, many once-promising dementia drugs...</q> still includes the keywords related to the main topic such as <q>dementia drugs</q>, which is a key to build a smooth transition. Furthermore, at the beginning of the statement, the author also uses <q>in recent years</q> to tell the readers that the focus in this paragraph is changed to  things that had just happened.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - In the second sentence of the first paragraph <q>Such efforts could help...</q>, the author uses the phrase <q>such effort</q> to refer to <q>early detection</q> in the previous sentence, which is a strategy involving the use of <b>demonstrative adjective</b> to emphasize the focus of the current writing.</li>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - In the third sentence of the next paragraph <q>It could also bring improvements...</q>, the author uses a <b>pronoun</b> <q>it</q> to refer to <q>identifying risks earlier</q> in the previous statement and create the logical connection.</li>
				</ul>

            <h2>Take-home Message</h2>
            <p class="insNote"><em>Instructor's Note:</em> Quote the paragraph where the take-home message is inferred from, and use one statement to summarize the take-home message and mark the statement with the color code <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">#80cdc1</span>.</p>
			<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author quotes the story of a participant taking part in the studies that investigate early indicators of dementia. In this story, the author's writing implies some positive aspects of understanding whether you have an early development of dementia. For example, the author shows that the odds of Alzheimer's disease is <q>lower than the participant had feared</q>. The author also quotes the participant's positive attitude toward the understanding of the risk despite the need to share their personal data, like <q>I would want to use them. I'd rather know than not</q>. Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">there are more advantages than disadvantages to use your personal data to reveal your chance of having dementia and it's better to get fully prepared.</span></p>
            <p class="quote"><q>Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. Alzheimer’s tends to run in families and, having watched his mother’s slow decline from the disease, he knew he had a higher chance of developing it. To Mr. Gondek’s relief, the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer’s by age 85 were about 19 percent — higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, but lower than he had feared. If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, he said, “I would want to use them. I’d rather know than not.”</q></p>
