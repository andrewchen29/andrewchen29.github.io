            <p class="quote"><q>When Carl Sagan imagined sending humans to Mars in his book "The Cosmic Connec tion," published in 1973, he posed a problem beyond such a mission's cost and complexity: the possibility that life already existed on the red planet and that it might not play nice. <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">"It is possible that on Mars there are pathogens;' he wrote, "organisms which, if transported to the terrestrial environment, might do enormous biological damage - a Martian plague."</span> Michael Crichton imagined a related scenario in his novel "The Andromeda Strain." Such situations, in which extraterrestrial samples contain dangerous tagalong organisms, are examples of backward contamination, or the risk of material from other worlds harming Earth's biosphere. "The likelihood that such pathogens exist is probably small," Sagan wrote, "but we cannot take even a small risk with a billion lives."</q></p>

                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a> - Early detection is better than late treatments</b>
                    <p>The topic of this section is made very clear in the first quoted statement in this section <q>Early detection is key</q>, and the rest of the section talks about why early detection is better, which is particularly indicated by the key phrase <q>the drugs are administered too late to be helpful</q>.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a> - Current approaches are expensive and may be unavailable</b>
                    <p>In the first statement of the section, the key phrase <q>For now</q> implies that this section focuses on the current approaches to the detection of dementia. Crucially, in the last statement, the author points of the problems with the current approaches using keywords or phrases like <q>expensive</q>, <q>invasive</q>, and <q>not available</q>.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - Section #2 is the first paragraph that follows the opening paragraph, so its first paragraph naturally carries on to elaborate on the main topic. In the first sentence <q>Early detection is key for intervention...</q>, the key phrase <q>Early detection</q> of dementia is linked back to the main topic of the essay, which creates a natural transition into the subtopic.</li>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - In the next paragraph of the same section, the first statement <q>In recent years, many once-promising dementia drugs...</q> still includes the keywords related to the main topic such as <q>dementia drugs</q>, which is a key to build a smooth transition. Furthermore, at the beginning of the statement, the author also uses <q>in recent years</q> to tell the readers that the focus in this paragraph is changed to  things that had just happened.</li>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - In the second sentence of the first paragraph <q>Such efforts could help...</q>, the author uses the phrase <q>such effort</q> to refer to <q>early detection</q> in the previous sentence, which is a strategy involving the use of <b>demonstrative adjective</b> to emphasize the focus of the current writing.</li>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - In the third sentence of the next paragraph <q>It could also bring improvements...</q>, the author uses a <b>pronoun</b> <q>it</q> to refer to <q>identifying risks earlier</q> in the previous statement and create the logical connection.</li>
