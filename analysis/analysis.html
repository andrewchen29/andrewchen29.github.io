            <h2>Thsis Statement</h2>
            In the opening paragraph <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, the sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement. It is possible that there are pathogens on the Mars. Though the likelihood is very small, we still need to prepare for the worst for it.

            <p class="quote"><q>When Carl Sagan imagined sending humans to Mars in his book "The Cosmic Connec tion," published in 1973, he posed a problem beyond such a mission's cost and complexity: the possibility that life already existed on the red planet and that it might not play nice. "It is possible that on Mars there are pathogens," he wrote, "organisms which, if transported to the terrestrial environment, might do enormous biological damage - a Martian plague." Michael Crichton imagined a related scenario in his novel "The Andromeda Strain." Such situations, in which extraterrestrial samples contain dangerous tagalong organisms, are examples of backward contamination, or the risk of material from other worlds harming Earth's biosphere. <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">"The likelihood that such pathogens exist is probably small," Sagan wrote, "but we cannot take even a small risk with a billion lives."</span></q></p>

                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a> - The Mars samples should be handle carefully and pristine.</b>
                    <p><q>No one can yet say for sure they are not harmful to Earthlings.</q> The Mars samples should be held in the special sample receiving facility which is capable of safely containing the most dangerous pathohens. It is also called the standard of <q>Biosafety Level 4, or BSL-4</q>. </p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a> - Regular lab is not capable for Mars samples.</b>
                    <p>The statement <q>no existing lab was both contained and clean enough for NASA</q> indicates that normal labs is not safe enough for the returned samples. The NASA scientists think that <q>facilities that handled biological horrors, maintain ultra-cleanrooms or manufacture innovative equipment for either purpose</q> might be a better place to keep the samples.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec4">[Sec. #4]</a> - Materials from Mars is different than before.</b>
                    <p>From <q>NASA deems "significant" backward contamination risk</q> we can see that these samples is different from moon rocks and dust, samples from asteroids and particles from solar wind and a comet. <q>We have to treat those samples as if they contain hazardous biological materials.</q> It is reasonable to takes the risks seriously, because we don't know how a planet works.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec5">[Sec. #5]</a> - How the Mars Sample Return mission begun.</b>
                    <p>The mission try to figure out how the planet works, which <q>cannot be done on site because scientists and their myriad instruments cannot travel there yet.</q> The author explain the process of mission in the first paragraph and indicates that it will end optimistically in 2033.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec6">[Sec. #6]</a> - The technological challenges of the Sample Receiving Facility.</b>
                    <p>The Sample Receiving Facility need to satisfied two requirements, <q>Earth doesn't touch the samples and the samples don't touch Earth.</q> , the goal of pristime and the preventtion of backward contamination. Regularly, the cleanrooms require positive air pressure while the high-containment labs need negative air pressure. It is hard to integrate two conditions in the same space. The NASA scientists need to <q>see how clean and contained facilities had kept themselves that way and to hope to determine how to best combine them.</q></p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec7">[Sec. #7]</a> - Problems hided in details.</b>
                    <p><q>The floors, ceilling and walls will coated with epoxy</q>. Researchers will use <q>microscopes, gloveboxes and robotics like "micromanipulators"</q> to handle materials.</p> These all could solve problems in general. But such as <q>elevated thresholds or narrow doorways</q> is not suitable for NASA equipment.
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec8">[Sec. #8]</a> - The final decision should be made soon.</b>
                    <p><q>The agency could alter an existing BSL-4 lab to be more pristine</q> or <q>build a new brick-and-mortar facility from the Earth-ground up, uniquely designed for its purposes.</q> No matter which plans NASA choose, they need to decide now. The <q>bureaucratic hangups</q> will cause the delay and present <q>significant programmatic risk</q> to the Mars Sample Return.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec9">[Sec. #9]</a> - Regulations and the public might also affect the project.</b>
                    <p>The project, Sample Receiving Facility and the space craft and its at-home facility should follows different regulations from government agencies. Also, the public is important too. <q>Being transparent with the public, Dr. Rummel said, is key not just to gaining public support but to keeping the effort accountable and safe.</q> By the <q>public interest</q>, second paragraph talk about how to prove the feasibility about the project to the public.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="example.html#sec10">[Sec. #10]</a> - New problem, new answer and new discovery.</b>
                    <p>The Mars Sample Retuen will post extraterrestrial risk to our planet. The samples could let us know about a planet's evolution and <q>what Earth may have been like eans ago</q>, while learning from how to eliminate the risk could <q>provide more benefit to humankind than whatever they learn from the samples.</q></p>

            <h2>Take-home Message</h2>
			<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author mentioned the risks of the Mars returned samples and the preparation  receiving them. The process of solving these technical challenges for receiving them might <q>frankly, more benefit to humankind</q>. The author also mentioned how valuable about <q>the samples</q> and how much new things the samples could teach us. From these statement, <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">the author shows readers that no matter how much we learn from the samples, we already make many benefits from learning how to receivie them.</span></p>
            <p class="quote"><q>Dr. Hanton nevertheless sees, in this extraterrestrial risk, a terrestrial boon. "It feels to me 
                like it's a new problem," he said. "It's going to need a new answer." NASA's investment in building a secure facility could result in better biolabs in general. "There's going to be very interesting technical challenges," he said, "that could provide, frankly, more benefit to humankind than whatever they learn from the sample." Dr. Harrington is, of course, excited about the samples. Mars is a geological and environmental time capsule, revealing what Earth may have been like eons ago. "We'll really be able to tell a lot about the Earth's evolution," Dr. Harrington said. It could bring us a small step closer to understanding how, say, a planet produces beings that produce a spacecraft that goes to another world and then brings that world back to this one.</q></p>
